Project Documentation:
Movie Review
Build a movie review application using React JS that allows users to search and filter
movies, view detailed information, and provide star-based ratings. This project will
focus on data display, input handling, and implementing a basic rating system for
user interaction.
What to do?
Movie Listings:
● Display a list of movies using mock data or a public movie API.
● Show essential movie details such as title, poster image, release year, and
genre.
● Layout should be responsive and easy to browse.
Search and Filter:
● Implement a search bar to allow users to find movies by title.
● Add filtering options based on genre, year, or rating.
Movie Details:
● On clicking a movie card, show detailed information such as description, cast
(if available), and release details.
● Display all relevant movie info in a clear and readable layout.

Ratings:
● Allow users to rate movies using a star-based rating system (e.g., 1–5 stars).
● Visually display average rating per movie (mock or based on user input).
● Optionally update UI to reflect user’s current rating.
User Features:
● Browse and search for movies easily.
● Filter movies by genre or year.
● View detailed information for any selected movie.
● Rate movies using stars and see the visual rating reflected on the UI.
Techstacks needs to be used:
● React JS
● TailwindCSS for styling
● React Hooks for state handling
● Public movie API like OMDB or use mock JSON
